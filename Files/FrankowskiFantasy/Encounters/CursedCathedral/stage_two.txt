/ You hear screaming and moans \
You are pacing forsaken hall, your legs are tangled beetween corpses of priest and local peasants
You are standing behind altar, floor is bloodstained. You are bowing and trying to open chest... its closed. You need a key.
You are looking around.
You have found key.
You have found second key. 
You have not found key;
Keys, are looking very similar, but one has carved tiny chest 
/Wchich one you chosing\
It suits greate. You have found old, dusty book. On front page you see angel who is fighting with deamon.
You are trying to place key in lock, you moving it left and right, right and left. Suddenly you hear cracking. You realised that its a wrong key you will never open anything with this key. 
You choose second key it suits greate. You have found old, dusty book. On front page you see angel who is fighting with deamon. You decied to go outised and return a book.
You you have found nothing, in bad mood you are pacing to cathedral gates
