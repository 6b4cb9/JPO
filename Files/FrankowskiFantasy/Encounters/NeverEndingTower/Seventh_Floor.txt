"Thank You, stranger !" - she said.
"You are one of that legendary heroes ?"
"Noo, i'm just looking for treasures, i heard about this tower, so i decide to try to come into it"
"What are you doing here ? Where are your parents ?" - I asked her
"I haven't got parents, they died 200 years ago... Sorry stranger, i must go, take it as a gift from me" 
She gave you an strange ring. You asked her "How can you 200 years ?!" But she disappeared in the air.
When you put this ring on a finger, you felt stronger, and you understand some phenomena in this tower.
(Your strength and wisdom are increasing by 1 !)
